/* The page loads, Ryu is standing still. You hover the mouse over Ryu, and he shifts to his ready pose. You stop hovering over Ryu and he goes back to still. You click on Ryu, and he leans forward and throws a Hadouken. He remains in that pose until you release your click, which causes Ryu to return to his ready pose. When you hit the “x” key, Ryu assumes his "looking cool" pose, and when you release “x” he returns to his ready pose. */
